# Unbrewd

[Live Site](http://www.unbrewd.us)

Unbrewd is a full-stack web app based off Untapped.com to research and
review different coffees that they've tried. It uses Ruby on Rails on the
backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and React and Redux on the frontend.

## Features & Implementation

### Drink Creation and Editing

#### Creation

If a user's favorite coffee isn't in the list of coffee's in our database
they can add it. After clicking the link they are redirected to the new drinks
form. If they need to add a roaster there's a link that opens a modal with the
roaster form.

Users have the ability to create, read, update, and delete drinks in the
database. In this form they log any thoughts the coffee, basic info,
. It's then added to the global feed and their own coffee
feed.

### Review feed

There are 2 different feeds to check out the different coffees tried. The
global feed is an updated feed of all coffees tried by all users as coffees
are reviewed.

The user coffee feed is an individuals personal list of coffees tried and
reviewed that's updated when they review a coffee.

### Profile

The user's profile is where they can find a condensed list of their recent
activity. It also includes user information, and coffee stats. The stats includes
the number of coffees reviewed and individual roasts tried. If it is the
current user's page, there is a button to update their information.

### Future Additions to the Site

## Top Rated

Add a top rated list for coffees and then a top rated for each individual
user. So users can see what's most popular and what other users like best.

## Comments and Cheers

I'd like to add the ability to comment and add cheers to checkin's so the
site's a little more social.

## Venues

Add a venue's element to the site so that users can also rate venues and find
coffee's by the venue they had the coffee at.
